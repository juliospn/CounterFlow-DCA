                <h3 id="DCA">What is DCA?</h3>
                <p>Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy that involves regularly buying assets at fixed
                    intervals. This helps reduce the impact of market fluctuations in the long run, especially when
                    dealing with a volatile asset like Bitcoin. DCA reduces emotional swings and requires no market or
                    price monitoring.</p>
                <p>It is known to be the safest and most profitable strategy in the long term.</p>

                <p>The DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) strategy with a focus on market sentiment is about combining the
                    advantages of regular buying with data that shows the sentiment and trends of the market.</p>
                <p>The idea is to buy more during periods of exhaustion of the downward trend and take profits in

                <h3 id="DCA-comparison">Comparison with "Buy the Dip" strategy</h3>
                <p>In the traditional market, especially in the American stock market, which is the most liquid and
                    valuable in the world, since the breaking of the gold standard in 1971, the stock market has been
                    highly correlated to financial stimulus. There are corrections and drops, but the S&P 500 index is
                    always rising, even after deep crises such as those of 2008 and 2000. This has allowed investors to
                    abuse "reckless" strategies that make sense in this majority bullish scenario.</p>
                <figure class="image-zoom">
                    <img class="img" src="./img/Buy The Dip vs DCA .png"

                    <figcaption>Chart simulating the Buy the Dip and DCA strategies applied to the American stock market
                        S&P 500. Illustrating that even miraculously hitting the market bottom, the Buy the Dip strategy
                        does not outperform the DCA strategy.<br> <a

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>One of these "reckless" strategies that work well only in bullish markets is "Buy the Dip" or even
                    the famous "Buy and Hold". However, in the Bitcoin market, which is highly volatile and cyclical,
                    these strategies do not work well. The image above shows a study that compared the "Buy the Dip"
                    strategy with the DCA strategy and showed that, even miraculously knowing the "bottom" of market
                    drops in the traditional market, the DCA strategy still outperformed the "Buy the Dip" strategy.</p>
                <p>In other words, in most situations, the concern and stress of trying to time the bottom is not worth
                    it. For the emotional well-being of the investor and even in terms of performance, the DCA strategy
                    ends up being much better, as it is not necessary to worry about market prices and news, only small
                    and constant investments.</p><p> It is from this analysis that a mixed strategy emerges, which takes
                    advantage of and combines the benefits of each strategy, especially for the Bitcoin market, which
                    does not only experience growth but also cycles.</p>

                <p>Market value increases much faster than profit realization, indicating that the market is
                    overheating, possibly due to investor greed (red zone). For the strategic investor, these times have
                    historically been favorable for profit-taking.</p>
                <p>We can divide different percentages of Bitcoin Unrealized Profit/Loss Relative to determine which
                    stage of the market we are in. This can be advantageous for the long-term strategic investor.</p>
                <p>The NUPL tool assists the investor in identifying which stage of the Bitcoin cycle they are in, which
                    can be combined with the DCA strategy to take advantage of opportunities during downtrends.</p>

                <p>To understand the Funding Rate, it is important to know that a huge percentage of Bitcoin trades are
                    made on the Futures Market. Therefore, the sentiment of Futures Market investors ends up being very
                    relevant and impactful on the final price behavior of Bitcoin.

                <p>The Bitcoin funding rate is a financing rate that traders pay or receive when trading Bitcoin futures
                    contracts. If the funding rate is positive, traders who are buying pay this funding rate to traders
                    who are selling. If the funding rate is negative, traders who are selling pay to those who are
                    buying.</p>
                <p>During Bitcoin price rallies, the funding rate tends to be positive as there are more traders buying
                    than selling futures contracts. This can indicate more optimism in the market regarding the future
                    price of Bitcoin. In price declines, the funding rate tends to be negative, indicating that there
                    are more traders selling than buying, which can signal a more pessimistic sentiment regarding the
                    future price of Bitcoin.</p>

                <h3 id="how-to">How to Implement the Strategy</h3>
                <p>Less is more. "Every four years" a cycle is initiated due to the halving, which causes price highs
                    and then corrections. The DCA strategy with Funding Rate and NUPL involves first using the NUPL
                    indicator to understand which stage of the Bitcoin cycle we are in.</p>
                <p> If NUPL is below 20%, the ideal
                    is to make small and constant investments whenever funding rate triggers appear. These triggers
                    indicate a low cycle phase in the oversold region, which can be a great buying opportunity in the
                    medium and long term.</p>
                <p>In addition, it is possible to use the same strategy when the price of Bitcoin enters the overbought
                    part of the cycle. In this case, NUPL and Funding Rate are also used to make small sales with the
                    intention of accumulating cash for when the oversold period returns.</p>
